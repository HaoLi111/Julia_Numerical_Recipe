Numerical Recipe for Julia Programming Language

## Note
This is NOT a package but a code-collection repository.

## Introduction

This repository contains pure Julia Language solutions to a number of numerical computing problems. The algorithms coded are either from coursebooks for numerical analysis, math modeling or inspired by other blocks of codes from Matlab/Mathematica forums, SF, and some C++ and Fortran Recipes.

However, it is worth notice that this repo of JL code is, or aimed to be, more Julian, that is, I would explore some new syntax possibilities, including heavy use of broadcasting (through map() or broadcast funciton.(object) ), function-scoping, and examples for distributed acceletation may be added later.

Specifically you would see how compact certain code can be written in JuliaLang - as compared to other languages. Arguably, compactness has cons, for which you may modify and make a pull request to make it CONCISE!
